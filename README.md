# Router Advertisement Daemon (radvd) Buildroot CI images

A Buildroot-based CI that allows checking radvd build against various CPU architectures and C libraries.  
This repository contains the script to generate customized prebuilt Buildroot images that are used by a GitHub action in the radvd repository.  
The prebuilt Buildroot images are automatically generated then stored in this repository [releases](https://github.com/radvd-project/radvd-ci/releases) section.
